### Computer Science Assignments

Solutions to Computer Science assignments from over the years. Folders in [solutions](solutions/) are in chronological order.

Any file that has `[plus1]` in its filename is encrypted with [**plus1**](https://gitlab.com/seanbreckenridge/plus1).

`plus1` adds one to each Unicode character in a file, to prevent the solutions from being indexed.

You can download and decrypt the files by running the following:

```
pip3 install git+https://gitlab.com/seanbreckenridge/plus1
git clone https://gitlab.com/seanbreckenridge/CS-Assignments seanbreckenridge
plus1 --force-delete -sdrf seanbreckenridge/solutions/
```

Note that some of these may not work since they depended on binaries/processes that ran on servers these were written on. (Notably Bash and PHP/JavaScript)
